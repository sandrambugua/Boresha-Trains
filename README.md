The online railway ticket reservation system 
The online railway ticket reservation system is a sophisticated web-based application that has been designed with a comprehensive set of features to make the process of booking train tickets convenient and seamless for users. The system is built around a central database that stores all relevant information about train schedules, routes, fares, and seat availability.
The system will provide a user-friendly interface that allows registered users to log in to their accounts and book train tickets. The system will provide users with real-time information about ticket availability, prices, and train schedules, which will make it easier for users to plan their journeys. Registered users will also view their booking history, print tickets, and make changes to their bookings as required.
The system will also include an administration login that enables administrators to manage train details, view user bookings, and make necessary changes to the system.
The booking window will be well-organized, easy to navigate, and will provide users with all the features they need to book their train tickets seamlessly. The system will also ensure that all sensitive information are secure, and user privacy is protected
